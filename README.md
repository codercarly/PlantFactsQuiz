Udacity/Google Android Baics Course: Final Project

A basic quiz app utilizing most of the Basics Course material. Some material I was able to figure out after reading what others had done. There's still a ton to learn but I was very pleased with the final product considering I have only been coding for about 8 months and before this course started, I had never touched Java or XML.

I was able to learn from others how to use the styles, colors, and strings xml files to keep unneccesary code from the activity_main. I saw many mentions of using the reference ID's in onCreate but I was unable to successfully get it to work. I also lose data what I rotate the phone. I found the Android reference code to elimiate that problem but I didn't include it in the code since I didn't completely understand how to properly utilize it.

I had a lot of fun doing this project! I can't wait to do more!
