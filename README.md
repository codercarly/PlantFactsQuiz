Udacity/Google Android Baics Course: Final Project

A basic quiz app utilizing most of the Basics Course material. Some material I was able to figure out after reading what others had done. There's still a ton to learn but I was very pleased with the final product considering I have only been coding for about 8 months and before this course started, I had never touched Java or XML.
